# Hornets Nest

The spreadsheet you'll be working with in this activity is infested with hornets! In place of numerical data, when you open your file you'll be greeted by cells filled with the words "Hornet", "Bug", or "Bee." Instead of manually dealing with the critters, you'll use VBA to do the work for you.

## Method

* Created a VBA script to handle the growing hornet infestation in your spreadsheet.

* In the three parts to this problem:

  * Part I: Counted the number of hornets found and displayed the number to the user in the form of a message box.

  * Part II: Modified the script such that it changes the word "Hornets" to "Bugs".

  * Part III: Modified the script a third time, this time keeping in mind that I had a limited number of bugs and bees. Used the full set of bugs and bees I had available to replace the hornets. If I ran out of bugs or bees I rovided the user with the message: "Oh no! We still have hornets..."

## To interate solution

* A table is inserted in the worksheet to repopulate the dataset with original data.
