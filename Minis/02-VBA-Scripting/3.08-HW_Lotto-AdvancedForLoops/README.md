# The VBA Lotto

## Method

* I developed a VBA script to find our winners for a local lotto drawing.

  * The results are, in order:

    * First: 3957481
    * Second: 5865187
    * Third: 2817729

  * I created a script that returned those lucky winners and printed them on the sheet.

    * For each winner I included the following pieces of information:

      * First name
      * Last name
      * The winning number

    * I placed them in winning order of First, Second, Third.

    * There is also be a message box that congratulates the first place winner.

## Bonus

* There may just be one other winner! Hence I used the below numbers for Wild Lotto Balls and whichever came up first in the list was the fourth place (runner-up) winner.

  * 2275339
  * 5868182
  * 1841402
