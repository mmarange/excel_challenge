# Case 2
  ## VBA Scripting

This is my VBA Scripting assignment, and here is what I did.

### Part 1:
* Determined the state from worksheet name and included the state as data in each worksheet
* Determined the year of each column and used that year as the new heading in each worksheet
* Formatted to data to currency

### Case 2: 
* Combined all worksheets in Case 1 into one worksheet called Combined_data
